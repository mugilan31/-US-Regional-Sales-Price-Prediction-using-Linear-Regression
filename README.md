US Regional Sales Price Prediction using Linear Regression! This project delves into a US regional price dataset, employing linear regression, a powerful algorithm for uncovering relationships between variables and making predictions.

Here's what's included:
*Data Exploration: I analyzed the data to understand trends and patterns in regional prices.
*Visualization: I created charts to visualize key insights, like the distribution of unit prices and sales channel performance.
*Linear Regression Model: I built a model to predict future regional prices based on historical data.
*Evaluation: I assessed the model's performance to identify its strengths and areas for improvement.
